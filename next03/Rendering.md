1. Client-Side Rendering (CSR):
   - In CSR, the rendering of the web page happens on the client-side (user's browser).
   - Initially, the server sends a minimal HTML file along with JavaScript code.
   - The JavaScript code is responsible for fetching data from an API and rendering the content dynamically on the client-side.
   - Examples: React with useEffect and fetch, Vue.js, Angular with HttpClient.

2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
   - In SSR, the rendering of the web page happens on the server.
   - The server fetches the data, renders the HTML with the data, and sends the fully rendered HTML to the client.
   - The client receives the fully rendered HTML and displays it directly.
   - Examples: Next.js (with getServerSideProps), Nuxt.js, Angular Universal.

3. Static Site Generation (SSG):
   - In SSG, the rendering of the web page happens at build time.
   - The server fetches the data, generates a fully rendered HTML page for each route, and saves them as static files.
   - When a user requests a page, the server serves the pre-generated static HTML file.
   - Examples: Next.js (with getStaticProps), Gatsby.js, Jekyll, Hugo.

4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):
   - ISR is an extension of SSG and is available in Next.js.
   - It combines the benefits of both SSR and SSG.
   - During the initial build, Next.js generates static HTML pages like SSG.
   - After the initial build, Next.js can periodically revalidate and update the data for specific pages, keeping them up-to-date without rebuilding the entire site.
   - Examples: Next.js (with getStaticProps and revalidate option).

Each rendering strategy has its own advantages and use cases. Here's a simplified comparison:

- CSR is good for highly interactive pages with frequent updates.
- SSR is suitable when you need dynamic data or personalized content on each request.
- SSG is great for content-heavy websites that don't require real-time data updates.
- ISR is ideal for combining the benefits of static generation with periodic data updates.

Choosing the right rendering strategy depends on factors like the type of content, data freshness requirements, performance needs, and development complexity.
